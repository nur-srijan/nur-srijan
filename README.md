# 👋 Hey, I’m Nur Srijan!

🚀 Future Engineer | 🧠 AI + Systems Thinker | 💻 Dev Tools Builder

## 🔭 My Mission

Craft tools and systems that think — not just compute.  
Because why stop at “smart” when we can aim for *strategic*?

Imagine agentic **AIs** making real-world decisions with the **cold precision** of a chess engine.  
I’m not here to build Jarvis. I’m here to build *Kasparov-level reasoning for real life.*

## 💡 Things I’ve Brought Into the World

### 🧩 [Markdown Rich Preview & Export](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nur-srijan.markdown-rich-preview)  
 Turn Markdown into GitHub-style elegance and export clean PDFs/HTMLs — no Pandoc hacks, just vibes.  
 > **Coming Soon:** Multi-editor support (JetBrains, Vim, Sublime?) and maybe AI-generated READMEs too!

### 🤖 Auto CI *(In Progress)*  
 A system that captures GitHub Actions logs and telemetry, sends them to a custom backend, and empowers AI agents to analyze and fix CI/CD pipelines autonomously.  
 Because CI should mean *Continuously Intelligent.*

### 🎮 Basic Tic-Tac-Toe Game ([Web](https://github.com/nur-srijan/tictactoe-web) & [Python](https://github.com/nur-srijan/tictactoe-python) versions)
 Build using Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning. Both Web (javascript implementation) and Python (with Tkinter) interfaces.


### ♟️ [Chess AI with Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning](https://github.com/nur-srijan/chess-minimax)
 A Python-based Chess implementation featuring multiple game modes and AI opponents using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning.
